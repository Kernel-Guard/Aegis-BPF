# CNCF Sandbox Application — AegisBPF

This document is a **submission-ready draft** of the AegisBPF application
to the CNCF Sandbox. It mirrors the questions on the official
[Sandbox Application form](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/new?template=application.yml)
and pre-populates each field from existing project documentation so that
filing the actual issue is a copy-and-paste exercise.

> ⚠️ **Pre-submission blockers** (must be resolved before filing the
> application — see [§Submission readiness](#submission-readiness) below):
>
> 1. Identify a CNCF TOC sponsor.
> 2. Add **at least one external maintainer** (different organization
>    than the founder). Tracked in [`MAINTAINERS.md`](../MAINTAINERS.md).
> 3. Decision: keep MIT or relicense to Apache-2.0. CNCF strongly
>    prefers Apache-2.0 for core project code; MIT is allowlisted
>    for dependencies but is unusual for new core CNCF projects.
> 4. Sign the [Contribution Agreement](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/agreements/Sample%20Contribution%20Agreement%20(2025).pdf)
>    once the application reaches that stage.
>
> The form fields below can be filled today; the four blockers above
> determine *when* the application can actually be submitted.

## Basic project information

### Project summary

Enforcement-first eBPF runtime security agent for Linux workloads —
in-kernel file, network, and exec deny via BPF-LSM with IMA-backed
trusted exec, OverlayFS copy-up handling, and signed cgroup-scoped
policy.

### Project description

AegisBPF is an open-source eBPF runtime security agent that **prevents**
unauthorized file, network, and process activity in the Linux kernel
using BPF Linux Security Module (LSM) hooks rather than detecting
events post-facto. Where Falco and Tracee observe and alert, and
Tetragon enforces via signal injection (which is racy versus syscalls
that have already taken effect), AegisBPF returns `-EPERM` from
`security_*` LSM hooks before the action completes — the same primitive
the kernel itself uses to enforce SELinux and AppArmor.

The project ships a single C++20 daemon, a Go-based Kubernetes operator
with an htmx web console, and 15 BPF programs covering file (`file_open`,
`inode_permission`, `inode_copy_up`), exec (`bprm_check_security` with
optional IMA-backed hash trust on kernel 6.1+), network (`socket_connect`,
`bind`, `listen`, `accept`, `sendmsg`, `recvmsg`), and selected kernel
hooks (`ptrace`, `module_load`, `bpf` syscall). It includes
deterministic LSM-based enforcement with a configurable signal escalation
path, an emergency break-glass with deadman TTL, signed policy bundles
(Ed25519), per-cgroup deny rules, a dedicated 4 MB priority ring buffer
for forensic-grade evidence, and SLSA v1.0 Build L3 provenance with
cosign-signed release artifacts.

The gap AegisBPF closes in the cloud-native ecosystem is a
**deterministic**, **enforcement-first**, **per-workload** eBPF security
engine that does not require AppArmor/SELinux fallback paths, ships
container-aware OverlayFS handling out of the box, and produces
audit-grade evidence by default. It complements (not replaces) Falco
(detection), Tetragon (signal-based enforcement), and bpfman (eBPF
program lifecycle management).

## Cloud native context

### Why this project belongs in CNCF

Cloud-native security telemetry has converged on eBPF — Falco
(Graduated, 2024), Tetragon (Cilium sub-project, parent Graduated),
KubeArmor (Sandbox), and bpfman (Sandbox) all use it. The category is
mature; what's still missing is a **deterministic enforcement-first**
agent that produces audit-grade evidence without compromising on
container compatibility (OverlayFS), kernel-version compatibility (CO-RE
+ BTF), or operational safety (deadman TTL, break-glass, signed
policies). KubeArmor is the closest peer but takes the opposite
portability bet — it routes through whichever LSM is available
(AppArmor / SELinux / BPF-LSM); AegisBPF is BPF-LSM-first by design,
which is the direction the kernel community itself is moving (BPF-LSM
is now static-key-gated since kernel 6.12, and BPF Token landed in 6.9
to enable unprivileged BPF program loading).

The CNCF would benefit because AegisBPF:

1. Closes a **real container-escape bypass** (`inode_copy_up`
   propagation) that no other agent in the landscape addresses.
2. Demonstrates **integrated supply-chain hardening** (SLSA v1.0 L3
   provenance, cosign keyless signing, SPDX + CycloneDX SBOMs, Sigstore
   Rekor) end-to-end on every release.
3. Ships **first-class compliance evidence** for NIST 800-53, NIST
   800-190, ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS 4.0, CIS Kubernetes, and MITRE
   ATT&CK — useful as a worked example for other projects.
4. Is **complementary** to Falco / Tetragon / Tracee / bpfman: it
   enforces where they detect, and runs alongside without conflict.

### Cloud native fit

AegisBPF is designed for Kubernetes-first deployment:

- DaemonSet via Helm chart (`helm/aegisbpf/`).
- Validating admission webhook with selector-based filtering and
  merged-policy reconciler.
- `AegisPolicy` and `AegisClusterPolicy` `v1alpha1` CRDs.
- Embedded htmx web console (`--enable-console` on the operator).
- Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboard pack (4 dashboards) +
  PrometheusRule alerting.
- OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter.
- SIEM-ready output formats (custom JSON + Elastic ECS today; OCSF +
  CEF on roadmap).

Standalone bare-metal and systemd-managed deployments are equally
supported (`packaging/systemd/aegisbpf.service`).

### Existing TAG engagement

None yet. Planned approach: present at the CNCF TAG-Security or
TAG-Runtime monthly meeting prior to (or as part of) the Sandbox
review process, per the CNCF Sandbox process guidance.

## Project status

### Current maturity

- **Released:** v0.5.1 (2026-04-23) on GitHub Releases with cosign
  keyless signatures, SLSA v1.0 Build L3 provenance attestations, SPDX
  2.3 + CycloneDX 1.6 SBOMs, signed Docker image at
  `ghcr.io/erenari/aegis-bpf`, and signed `.deb` / `.rpm` packages.
- **Tests:** 217+ unit + contract tests passing (`ctest`); kernel-matrix
  e2e on virtme-ng; nightly fuzz across 5 libFuzzer targets;
  performance gate on every release with self-hosted runner.
- **Hardening:** seccomp-bpf allowlist, Landlock self-sandbox (opt-in
  `--landlock`), FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, stack-protector-strong, PIE, full
  RELRO, atomic-write file persistence, Ed25519-signed break-glass
  tokens.
- **CI:** 38 GitHub Actions workflows including kernel-matrix, perf SLO
  gate, MITRE ATT&CK schema gate, BPF compiler matrix (clang 14/15/16/17),
  reproducibility check, scorecard, security scanning, weekly comparison
  vs Falco + Tetragon.
- **Compliance evidence:** see `docs/compliance/` — NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5,
  ISO/IEC 27001:2022, SOC 2 Type II evidence kit, PCI DSS 4.0, CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark v1.8, MITRE ATT&CK tag schema with CI
  enforcement, OpenSSF Best Practices self-assessment (Passing tier
  met; pending formal submission).

### Adoption

**Honest current state:** AegisBPF is a young project (first commit
2026-01-11). The `ADOPTERS.md` file exists with the contribution
template; named adopters are actively being recruited to meet the bar
for CNCF Incubation. The project's own staging deployment and
self-hosted CI runners count as eat-our-own-dogfood usage but are not
listed as third-party adopters.

This is the largest gap to address between Sandbox and Incubation. The
Sandbox application itself does not require named adopters — the
[Sandbox README](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox#readme) establishes
that Sandbox is for early-stage projects with growth potential — but
this is disclosed honestly to the TOC.

### Maintainers and governance

- **Active maintainer:** Eren Arı ([@ErenAri](https://github.com/ErenAri)),
  Independent. Project lead, BPF programs, daemon, release.
- **Vendor neutrality:** project is independently maintained; not
  controlled by or affiliated with any company. No commercial product
  is built around the project.
- **Governance:** [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md) defines
  Maintainer / Reviewer / Contributor / Security Team roles, lazy
  consensus for routine changes, RFC + 2-maintainer approval for
  breaking changes, branch protection on `main` with required status
  checks, CODEOWNERS enforcement on sensitive paths, signed-tag
  requirement for releases.
- **Pre-submission gap:** [`MAINTAINERS.md`](../MAINTAINERS.md) actively
  solicits a co-maintainer from a different organization. CNCF
  Incubation requires this; it is not a Sandbox blocker but is
  disclosed as a near-term commitment.
