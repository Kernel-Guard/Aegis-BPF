---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Industry Recognition & Ecosystem Integration (3-6 months)

### 1.1 eBPF Foundation & CNCF Engagement
**Status:** 🟡 Not Started
**Impact:** 🔥 Critical for adoption

**Actions:**
- [ ] Submit AegisBPF to [eBPF Foundation project gallery](https://ebpf.io/projects/)
- [ ] Apply for CNCF Sandbox status (requires TOC presentation)
- [ ] Present at eBPF Summit 2026 (CFP typically opens Q1)
- [ ] Contribute to [cilium/ebpf](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf) or [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf) upstream
- [ ] Write guest blog post for eBPF.io or CNCF blog

**Success Metrics:**
- Listed on ebpf.io/projects
- 1+ conference talk accepted
- 500+ GitHub stars
- 50+ external contributors

**Resources:**
- eBPF Foundation: https://ebpf.io/get-involved/
- CNCF Sandbox requirements: https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/sandbox.md

---

### 1.2 Comparative Benchmarking & Performance Leadership
**Status:** 🟡 Partial (internal benchmarks exist)
**Impact:** 🔥 Critical for technical credibility

**Actions:**
- [ ] **Head-to-head benchmarks** vs Falco, Tetragon, Tracee, KubeArmor,
  run via `scripts/compare_runtime_security.sh` on a single clean host
  with all agents installed (see `docs/COMPETITIVE_BENCH_METHODOLOGY.md`).
  Required workloads:
  - File open overhead (`perf_open_bench`)
  - Network connect/bind latency (`perf_connect_bench`)
  - Memory footprint under load (`ps`/`cgroup.memory.current` snapshots)
  - CPU overhead at 10k events/sec (`perf stat`)
- [ ] **Publish benchmark methodology.** Already partially done:
  `docs/COMPETITIVE_BENCH_METHODOLOGY.md` + `scripts/compare_runtime_security.sh`.
  Extend with reproducible GitHub Actions workflow once a runner with all
  four agents is available.
- [ ] **Populate the performance comparison matrix** from the driver's
  `results.json` output. **Do not hand-write the table.** Earlier drafts
  of this doc contained hand-written numbers (27/45/38/52% overhead,
  12/85/45/120 MB idle memory, etc.) copied from blog posts — those
  numbers were never measured on the same hardware as AegisBPF and have
  been removed as part of the 2026-04-08 honesty pass. See
  `docs/PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md` "What is *not* claimed" for context.
- [ ] Add **benchmark CI workflow** comparing against latest Falco/Tetragon releases
- [ ] Document **performance optimization techniques** used (inode-first lookups, compact deny maps, event sampling, etc.)

**Artifacts:**
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md`
- `benchmarks/vs_falco.sh`, `benchmarks/vs_tetragon.sh`
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/competitive-benchmarks.yml`

  - Performance: 0.8% CPU overhead, 15 MB RAM per node
  - Incidents: 0 false positives in 6 months, 23 real threats blocked

  ```
- [ ] **Record demo video** (10 min):
  - Zero-to-enforcement in <5 minutes
  - Live block of crypto-miner container

## 💰 Budget Estimate (18-month timeline)

| Item                          | Cost        | Priority |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Security audit (NCC Group)    | $40,000     | P0       |
| Bug bounty program (1 year)   | $10,000     | P1       |
| Conference travel (3 talks)   | $15,000     | P1       |
| Video production (professional)| $8,000     | P2       |
| Cloud compute (ARM64 testing) | $5,000      | P1       |
| Swag/stickers (contributors)  | $2,000      | P2       |
| **Total**                     | **$80,000** |          |

**Bootstrap approach (if budget-constrained):**
- Do self-audit (free, but less credible)
- Skip bug bounty initially
- Record videos in-house (lower quality OK)
- Use free tier cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure credits)
- **Revised total:** $15k (conference travel only)
